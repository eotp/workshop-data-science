# Materials for a Workshop on Data Science


This workshop focuses on data science with Python. We will use libraries/modules such as `numpy`, `scipy`, `statsmodels`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`, among others.


## Part A - Exploratory Data Analysis
The first part of the workshop focuses on data I/O, data munging, data visualizations and basic statistics.

* data I/O
* data types and level of measurement (numeric,  categorical, ...)
* dealing with missing values
* indexing, subsetting, filtering
* descriptive statistics
* split-apply-combine paradigm
* visualizations


## Part B - Predictive Modeling
The second part of the workshop focuses on predictive modeling with shallow learning algorithms.

* data munging
* feature engineering
* inferential statistics
* shallow learning algorithms (regression, tree-based ensemble learning, support vector machines,...)
* model selection
* hyper parameter tuning
* model validation
